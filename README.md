# P1. Exercise A: handling sequences in strings.

Jupyter Notebook is an "open-source web application that allows you 
to create and share documents that contain live Python code, equations,
visualizations and narrative text" (http://jupyter.org/). 
This means that you can write Python code in your web browser 
(Chrome, Safari, Firefox) and mix in human readable text.

Juypter notebooks are really useful for scientists because
they make "data analysis easier to record, understand and reproduce" 
as explained in this
[Nature Article: Interactive notebooks: Sharing the code
](http://doi.org/10.1038/515151a). 
Note that the article discusses Juypter Notebooks 
using their original name "IPython Notebooks". 
I use Jupyter Notebook in my research, for instance 
including [a notebook containing data analysis and graph plotting
](https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798318002541/ba5278sup3.html), 
as part of a
[research paper](https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798318002541).

## Getting Started Instructions using Azure Notebooks

It is pretty easy to install the software needed to run Jupyter on 
your computer (see below) but in these practicals we will be using 
Microsoft Azure Notebooks. 

[Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/)
is a free service that allows anyone to develop and run code
in their browser using Jupyter without installing
any software on their computer. 
Azure Notebooks is provided by Microsoft and requires 
a Microsoft Account to use (Anglia Ruskin students should use their 
ARU account). A great feature of Azure Notebooks is that it is
easy to share your notebooks with online links (provided the library
settings are "public"). We will use this feature in the "seminars".

[![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)
](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-intro/)
* To import this practical directly to your Azure Notebooks account
  just click on the the *launch azurenb* icon above.
* Login to your Microsoft Account,  Anglia Ruskin students should use their ARU account,
  as explained 
  [here](https://web.anglia.ac.uk/it/services/studentemail/login.phtml) 
  and in this 
  [video](https://web.anglia.ac.uk/media/videos/ITServices/loginGuide.mp4).
* On the *Import from GitHub?* page that will be presented click on the **Import** button.
* In the *Create New Library* window that then appears, accept the defaults and click on the **Import** button.
* Once you have imported the practical then, in Azure Notebooks Library, click on the 
  **introducing_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb** 
  notebook to run your first Jupyter Notebook and work through it.

## Getting Started Instructions using local Jupyter Notebook installation

It is best to use Azure Notebooks for this practical but if there is a problem with doing
this you can install Jupyter Notebook on your computer and run it locally.
To install Jupyter Notebook follow instructions at https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

To use this practical with Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer you will need to first download it:

[<img src="images/download_zip.png" alt="Download zip" width="50px"/>](https://github.com/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-intro/archive/master.zip)

* Click on the *Download zip* icon above.
* Once the file has downloaded, unzip the file†. 
* Move the **ibdsA-intro-master** folder created to where you want to work†. 
* Start Jupyter Notebook† opening a browser tab/window.
* Open the **introducing_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb** 
  notebook by clicking on it in your browser. Work through the notebook.

> † How you do this varies between Windows, Mac and Linux computers.
