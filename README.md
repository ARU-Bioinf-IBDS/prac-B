# Exercise A: handling sequences in strings.

Before starting this exercise you should work through
**Chapter 1 Python Basics** from the
[DataCamp online course Intro to Python for Data Science
](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science).  
We will then use what you have learnt there to explore how biological 
sequence data can be handled in Python.

To use this exercise you should either:

* Import the exercise as a library into your Azure Notebooks account,
  by clicking on: 

  [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)
  ](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-ex-A/)

  If this unfamiliar, please review: 
  [Getting Started Instructions using Azure Notebooks
  ](https://github.com/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-intro#getting-started-instructions-using-azure-notebooks).

* or if you are using a local Jupyter Notebook installation, then 
  download:

  [<img src="images/download_zip.png" alt="Download zip" width="50px"/>
  ](https://github.com/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-ex-A/archive/master.zip)

  then unzip the file and move the directory to where you are storing your work.
  If this unfamiliar, please review: 
  [Getting Started Instructions using local Jupyter Notebook installation
  ](https://github.com/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-intro#getting-started-instructions-using-local-jupyter-notebook-installation).

Then in Azure Notebooks or Jupyter Notebook:
* open the workbook **ex_A_workbook.ipynb** and work through it.
* once you have completed the workbook, then move onto the homework book **ex_A_homework.ipynb**
* we will go through everyones completed notebook in *Seminar A*.
