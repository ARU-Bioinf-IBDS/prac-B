# P1. Exercise A: handling sequences in strings.

Before starting this exercise you should work through
**Chapter 1 Python Basics** from the
[DataCamp online course Intro to Python for Data Science
](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science).
We will then use what you have learnt there to explore how biological 
sequence data can be handled in Python.

To use this exercise you should either:

* Import the exercise as a library into your Azure Notebooks account,
  by clicking on: 

  [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)
  ](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-ex-A/)

## Getting Started Instructions using local Jupyter Notebook installation

It is best to use Azure Notebooks for this practical but if there is a problem with doing
this you can install Jupyter Notebook on your computer and run it locally.
To install Jupyter Notebook follow instructions at https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

To use this practical with Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer you will need to first download it:

[<img src="images/download_zip.png" alt="Download zip" width="50px"/>](https://github.com/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-intro/archive/master.zip)

* Click on the *Download zip* icon above.
* Once the file has downloaded, unzip the file†. 
* Move the **ibdsA-intro-master** folder created to where you want to work†. 
* Start Jupyter Notebook† opening a browser tab/window.
* Open the **introducing_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb** 
  notebook by clicking on it in your browser. Work through the notebook.

> † How you do this varies between Windows, Mac and Linux computers.
