# Practical B: handling sequences in strings.

Before starting this exercise you should work through
**Chapter 1 Python Basics** from the
[DataCamp online course Intro to Python for Data Science
](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science).  
We will then use what you have learnt there to explore how biological 
sequence data can be handled in Python.

To use this exercise you should either:

## Getting Started Instructions using Azure Notebooks

It is pretty easy to install the software needed to run Jupyter on 
your computer (see below) but in these practicals we will be using 
Microsoft Azure Notebooks. 

[Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/)
is a free service that allows anyone to develop and run code
in their browser using Jupyter without installing
any software on their computer. 
Azure Notebooks is provided by Microsoft and requires 
a Microsoft Account to use (Anglia Ruskin students should use their 
ARU account). A great feature of Azure Notebooks is that it is
easy to share your notebooks with online links (provided the library
settings are "public"). We will use this feature in the "seminars".

* To import this practical directly to your Azure Notebooks account
  just click on the the *launch azurenb* icon:
  [![Launch Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)
  ](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/ARU-Bioinf-IBDS/prac-B/)
* Login to your Microsoft Account,  Anglia Ruskin students should use their ARU account,
  as explained 
  [here](https://web.anglia.ac.uk/it/services/studentemail/login.phtml) 
  and in this 
  [video](https://web.anglia.ac.uk/media/videos/ITServices/loginGuide.mp4).
* On the *Import from GitHub?* page that will be presented click on the **Import** button.
* In the *Create New Library* window that then appears, accept the defaults and click on the **Import** button.
* Once you have imported the practical then, in Azure Notebooks Library, click on the 
  **workbook_B.ipynb** 
  notebook to run your first Jupyter Notebook and work through it.

## Getting Started Instructions using Google Colab

Google Colab is another service that allows you to run and work on Jupyter 
in the cloud. 
* If you have problems in using Azure Notebooks (above) and do not yet have a 
  local Jupyter Notebook installation (next section below) then use Google Colab
* Colab requires a Google login (that you will already have if you use gmail) and
  uses GoogleDrive for storage.
* The Google Colab user interface is different from Jupyter Notebook but straight forward to use.

To start this practical using Google Colab:
* **Watch this video showing how to use Colab**
  *TODO: osmart 23 Sep 2019: Record video on Colab* then ... 
* [workbook_B.ipynb ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)
  ](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ARU-Bioinf-IBDS/prac-B/blob/master/workbook_B.ipynb)
* [homework_B.ipynb ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)
  ](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ARU-Bioinf-IBDS/prac-B/blob/master/homework_B.ipynb)

## Getting Started Instructions using local Jupyter Notebook installation

It is best to use Azure Notebooks for this practical but if there is a problem with doing
this you can install Jupyter Notebook on your computer and run it locally.
To install Jupyter Notebook follow instructions at https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

* if you are using a local Jupyter Notebook installation, then 
  * download [workbook_B.ipynb](
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARU-Bioinf-IBDS/prac-B/master/workbook_B.ipynb)
    by right clicking on the link and selecting *"Save Link As"*
  * download [homework_B.ipynb](
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARU-Bioinf-IBDS/prac-B/master/homework_B.ipynb)
    by right clicking on the link and selecting *"Save Link As"*

  Once you have downloaded the notebooks move them to a directory where you are
  storing your work for this module (I would advise calling this `IBDS` and placing this in a
  folder that is automatically backed up to OneDrive, GoogleDrive or similar). 


Then in Azure Notebooks or Jupyter Notebook:
* open the workbook **workbook_B.ipynb** and work through it.
* once you have completed the workbook, then move onto the homework book **homework_B.ipynb**
* then follow the instructions on Canvas page:
